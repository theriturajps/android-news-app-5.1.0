But a teardown published Monday from the&nbsp;folks at iFixit found the device a chore to take apart&nbsp;to access its array of internal parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the event of a serious hardware problem, most laptop owners would never tear apart their device, instead relying on the vendor or a repair shop to do the hard labor. But the repairability of a tech product is important in that it tells us how well the manufacturer put all the internal parts together and how expensive the device may be to fix when it&#39;s no longer under warranty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did the Surface Book score on iFixit&#39;s repairability scale? It received a grade of 1 out of 10 (1 being the worst).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind this is a slim laptop that can convert into a tablet via a detachable keyboard, so Microsoft had to squeeze a lot into a small package. The iFixit team found a variety of components glued or soldered on, making them difficult to remove. The processor and memory are both soldered to the motherboard. A strong adhesive is affixed to many components, including the display, base cover and both batteries. The base battery is &quot;very heavily glued,&quot; according to iFixit, so removing and replacing it would not be an easy task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another &quot;gotcha&quot; is that many of the internal parts are located on the backs of their circuit boards, which means you have to remove the entire motherboard to replace them. Finally, the motherboard itself is inserted upside down and &quot;sprawls throughout the entire chassis, resembling some kind of nightmarish Tetris piece,&quot; iFixit said. Just accessing the motherboard sounds like a battle not for the faint of heart.</p>\r\n', '1496131611_9987-2015-11-05.jpg', 1, '', 'cda11up', 'Post', '', 6221, '2023-06-07 06:09:45'),

He said: &quot;I have no beef with how #Windows10 *looks*. I&#39;m disappointed it *works* just like XP. I understand that&#39;s a feature for many. Not for me!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft declined to comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, had Microsoft pleased Duarte taste buds, I&#39;m confident that he would have immediately emitted many tweets praising Redmond&#39;s creativity and berating himself for not being as creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, he did offer a form of praise for Microsoft that some may see as being faint to invisible: &quot;Man, I struck a nerve! Overly clever tweetbait aside, I&#39;ve always liked [what] Microsoft was attempting to do with Windows 8 -- change the paradigm.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with the paradigm is that it appears to be narrowing all the time. The real estate on phones is becoming samey. Designers seem to find it hard to break through their chosen (design) language barriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you were to look at the work of Microsoft and Google, you might decide that the former has attempted more radical design than the latter, both in hardware and software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft may not have always been successful, but the intent was clearly there.</p>\r\n', '1496131647_5280-2015-11-05.jpg', 1, '', 'cda11up', 'Post', '', 6410, '2023-06-06 04:03:31'),

Wolastoqiyuk Lintuwakonaw, out Friday (April 6), is an 11-song fusion of his ancestors&#39; archival recordings and his own classical and pop influences, intended to disrupt the &ldquo;bilingual Anglo-centric Canadian music narrative,&rdquo; he tells Billboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 27-year-old -- who is a member of the Tobique First Nations in northwestern New Brunswick, and studied music in Halifax, Nova Scotia -- doesn&#39;t believe this music should be &ldquo;collecting dust on a museum shelf,&rdquo; so he took five years to painstakingly put this album together, transcribing Wolastoq songs more than a century-old &mdash; once banned from being performed in public due to the Canadian government&#39;s discriminatory Indian Act from 1876 &mdash; to re-introduce them to the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dutcher sat down with Billboard over sweetgrass tea at Toronto&#39;s NishDish, a traditional Anishinaabe restaurant, to chat about the album, give us a history lesson &mdash; and teach us some Wolastoq language basics. Be sure to try them on him if you see his show in New York at Joe&#39;s Pub, May 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To start with, there&#39;s about 60 different Aboriginal languages Canada and Cree is the biggest with 83,000 speakers, according to Statistic Canada, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cree is the biggest linguistic group, for sure, followed by Anishinaabemowin, which is the Ojibway [19,000], or what&#39;s spoken around here, and then Inuktitut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do they have commonalities?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh yeah. It&#39;s like the language groups in Europe. Think about the romantic languages like French and Italian, they&#39;re so close together because geographically they came out of the same area. It&#39;s similar here too, I can&#39;t fully understand what they speak here, but you notice certain words, like our word for &ldquo;bear&rdquo; is the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was it important in your family to learn your native language?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definitely. I&#39;m from New Brunswick originally, so that&#39;s on the east coast of Canada. My mother spoke the language growing up, and she understood the importance of passing that on to us,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I&#39;m going to be talking to you about an album you made to preserve and expand your language, then I should know how to pronounce Wolastoq.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wool-las-took. The language, is Wolastoqey wool-las-two-gway. The name of the river is Wolastoq and the name of my people, &ldquo;The People of the River,&rdquo; is Wolastoqiyik, [pronounced] Willisto-wee-ek, and that&#39;s the first word of the record title. So the name of the record is Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonaw &mdash; wool-las-two-wi-ig lint-two-wah-gun-ah-wa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does it compare to the English language in terms of consonants and vowels, and how many words you have?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It came out of a different hemisphere than English did, so even the ways that we think about the world and how we position ourselves within the world are different. It&#39;s hard to explain for somebody that doesn&#39;t speak the language, but it&#39;s just a totally different positionality in how we see the world in the language. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important for us to hang on to that too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elders say that our language comes from the land; it&#39;s intimately tied. You see a tree, but I don&#39;t see a tree; I see a ƏpƏsiyik [pron. oposiyik]. I see the world in a different way based on the way that I speak and the way that I experience things. We have like 20 different words to describe that tree &mdash; in the bark, in certain times of season. So much to say that there&#39;s an intimate relationship between language and land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, as a young person with access to that language, a lot of young people don&#39;t speak my language in our community, I was very fortunate in that my mother was able to pass on some, and through this record I&#39;ve been able to double down on my efforts in revitalizing our language and I&#39;ve been working with our stories, and telling our stories in the language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your family and the elders must be thrilled.</p>\r\n', '1523091463_JeremyDutcher.jpg', 1, '', 'cda11up', 'Post', '', 8911, '2023-05-26 22:08:21'),

(29, 6, 'The Questions Congress Needs to Ask Mark Zuckerberg', '2018-04-07 11:54:55', '<p>Mark Zuckerberg is probably wearing out his flashcards as he prepares to be the sole subject of two congressional hearings, where lawmakers will take turns grilling the Facebook CEO about the policies that let an app developer cart away and inappropriately share data on as many as&nbsp;87 million Facebook users. The first is a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on Tuesday. The next day, Zuckerberg will answer questions from members of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without&nbsp;any specific, wide-reaching legislation&nbsp;on the table but lots of public anger toward Facebook, expect members of Congress to ask difficult and sensational questions designed to put the executive on the defensive. They&rsquo;ll have no shortage of transgressions to focus on. There&rsquo;s the fake news that spread on the platform throughout the 2016 campaign and the ways in which&nbsp;Russian operatives&nbsp;have used Facebook to try to manipulate U.S. voters. Or how Facebook, which is the second-largest online ad company in the world, allowed advertisers&nbsp;to market explicitly to people&rsquo;s bigotries, as their software suggested ad-targeting terms like &ldquo;Jew haters&rdquo; and &ldquo;threesome rape.&rdquo; And then there&rsquo;s the reason Zuckerberg finally relented to calls that he testify, the scandal involving political-data firm Cambridge Analytica, wherein the Facebook data of tens of millions people was harvested&nbsp;off the platform&nbsp;and allegedly used to help Trump&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this happened on Zuckerberg&rsquo;s watch&mdash;with virtually no federal laws that would have protected Americans&rsquo; privacy and the health of the country&rsquo;s information ecosystem. Depending on what happens at Tuesday&rsquo;s and Wednesday&rsquo;s hearings, Facebook might not stay unregulated for very long. The only major legislative proposal currently drafted and seeking support is the Honest Ads Act, championed by Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner and Republican Sen. John McCain. That bill would require political advertisements on Facebook to list who paid for them, just like political ads on radio, print, and television do, and would levy fines on social media companies that don&rsquo;t follow the rules. On Friday, Facebook executives&nbsp;said in a blog postthat the company does support&nbsp;the Honest Ads Act, although Zuckerberg&nbsp;told Wired&nbsp;last month that he doesn&rsquo;t expect that bill to pass. Considering the public blowback his company is currently facing, that legislation might be the easiest thing for Congress to pull off the shelf to show Americans that Facebook won&rsquo;t pass through this controversy without consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In broad strokes, most of the concerns members of Congress will likely raise will center on questions of user privacy, election integrity, and the company&rsquo;s indisputable impact on how Americans communicate and get their news. (Some Republicans will probably also raise questions of whether Facebook is in some way biased against conservatives.) Throughout both hearings, lawmakers will likely highlight reporting on how Facebook&rsquo;s internal culture and policies reveal that the company was well aware of how its platform was being misused and yet decided not to take the substantial steps to fix it, all the while continuing to be one of the most valuable companies in the world with control over how billions of people get information and stay connected to their personal and professional communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the committee members really want to move the ball forward in terms of what we know about Facebook, here are some questions they might consider asking Zuckerberg while he&rsquo;s under oath.</p>\r\n', '1523102193_zuck.jpg', 1, '', 'cda11up', 'Post', '', 9241, '2023-06-07 06:13:21'),

Of course, there&rsquo;s always a chance things could speed up if development goes well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind these dates could vary by region, carrier, or various other factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>December 2021</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Z Fold 3</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Z Flip 3</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>January 2022</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Z Fold 2</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Z Flip</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Z Flip 5G</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy S20+/S20 Ultra/S20 FE</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Note 20/Ultra</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Note 10/10+/10+ 5G</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Fold</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>February 2022</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Galaxy A52 5G</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy S20</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy S10 5G</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy S10</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy S10e</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy S10+</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy S10 Lite</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Tab S7</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Tab S7+</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Tab S7+ 5G</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>March 2022</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Tab S7 FE</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>April 2022</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Galaxy A51 5G</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy A51</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy A71 5G</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Tab S7 FE 5G</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Tab S6 Lite</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>May 2022</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Tab S6</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Tab Active 3</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Tab A7 (2020)</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy A42 5G</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy A32 5G</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>June 2022</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Galaxy Tab A7 Lite</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy XCover Pro</li>\r\n	<li>July 2022</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy A21</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy A12</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>August 2022</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Galaxy A02s</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy A01</li>\r\n	<li>Galaxy A11</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', '1686216579_samsung_android12.jpg', 1, '', 'cda11up', 'Post', '', 9823, '2023-06-08 22:51:34'),
(33, 2, 'Latest Google Pixel Watch rumors have it sounding more and more worthy of the name', '2023-06-08 10:29:53', '<p>As unbelievable as it may seem, we might be just months away from a first-party Google-branded smartwatch finally existing. After initial rumors and leaked marketing materials started appearing online earlier this month, anything seemed possible. A new report dives deeper into what you can expect from Google&#39;s wearable next year, including its name, software features, and even a peek into its processor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s start from the top. These revived rumors made it clear that Google wouldn&#39;t be using its Fitbit brand to market the watch &mdash; it&#39;s getting its own Wear OS device sometime in the future &mdash; but that &quot;Pixel Watch&quot; wasn&#39;t set in stone either. According to new details from 9to5Google, we&#39;re starting to better understand how the company might brand its first-ever wearable. In an update to the Google app on Android, a reference to &quot;PIXEL_EXPERIENCE_WATCH&quot; points at the gadget sharing in the Pixel branding. The company uses these &quot;experience&quot; tags to mark exclusive features, and it looks like this specific watch could follow in the footsteps of phones like the Pixel 6.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name &quot;Pixel Watch,&quot; or some slight variation on it, makes a lot of sense. Google has finally started taking hardware a lot more seriously with the release of its recent flagship phones, and earlier rumors suggest a similar path with its watch. Keeping its mobile-focused lineup under one brand &mdash; just as its smart home gear uses the &quot;Nest&quot; name &mdash; makes a whole lot of sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what might those exclusive features cover? We don&#39;t know much about the software experience on this gadget just yet &mdash; hell, we barely know what Wear OS 3 looks like without Samsung&#39;s One UI skin in the first place &mdash; but it sounds like the newest version of Assistant that first launched with the Pixel 4 might make an appearance. It would allow for voice commands and queries to run directly on the watch, rather than always reaching out to the web for every single action. 9to5Google even managed to find an Assistant-related asset in the Wear OS 3 emulator, complete with a light bar design exclusive to Pixel phones.</p>\r\n', '1686220224_pixel.jpg', 1, '', 'cda11up', 'Post', '', 9901, '2023-06-08 22:51:40'),

Shortly after launch, the devices got a software update that optimized the heart rate sensor. Amazfit is now rolling out a second update, complete with some welcome quality-of-life improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This update includes features like the ability to manually calibrate altitude, a screen lock function in the control center, and a background app status indicator on watch faces to the devices (via Tizen Help). Amazfit GTR 3 Pro owners can now access the GoPro Mini app in the Zepp app store. Of the three watches, it&rsquo;s the only one that supports Zepp, so don&rsquo;t expect the others to get the GoPro Mini app or any other software added down the road. The changelog also mentions the usual system stability improvements and bug fixes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Amazfit GTR 3 offers excellent battery life and health tracking, but it struggles to stand apart from other smartwatches. That said, the devices are relatively cheap, and the company is showing a strong update game early on.
